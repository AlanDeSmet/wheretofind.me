Charter
=======

Where to Find Me is a site to help people keep in touch and still find each other in the face of instability in the world of closed social media sites.

Our intent is always and forever to put the humans using this site first, by valuing people's right to privacy, self-identification, and their right to change their mind.

We hope to keep the site simple, to question every feature we add and not just add it because it's "what websites do", and to communicate clearly, honestly, and directly with the people who use the site.

Roadmap
-------

With all that in mind, we should consider what directions we want this site to take, and what directions we *don't* want to take.

The guiding philosophy, as I have conceived of it, is that Where to Find Me is the map, not the destination. We won't have statuses, we won't have posts, we won't have *content as such* here. We won't pull that in from other connected sites, either. We won't sell your data and we won't run ads. If we have to raise money to keep this running, our first choice will be memberships: selling a service for money is a lot more honest and sustainable than partaking in surveillance capitalism.

We are interested in pursuing matters like verified ownership of linked identities, whether by OAuth logins or IndieWeb microformats. We are interested in pursuing programmatic access to the data here, so that people can extend it themselves.
